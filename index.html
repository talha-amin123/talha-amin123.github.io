    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am an MS in Business Analytics candidate at UC Davis with a Mechanical Engineering foundation and experience spanning infrastructure analytics, industrial systems, and marketing optimization.
        My work sits at the intersection of physical systems and data systems — building statistical models, automating ETL pipelines, and applying machine learning to translate complex operational environments into structured, decision-ready insights.
        As a startup co-founder, I led data-driven marketing initiatives that increased revenue by 25% and scaled the customer base by 40% through segmentation and A/B testing. In parallel, my experience in industrial manufacturing and infrastructure analytics strengthened my ability to analyze reliability, performance drivers, and large-scale system efficiency.
        I focus on building statistically rigorous, reproducible models that bridge analytics and execution — turning data into measurable business impact.
